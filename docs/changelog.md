## 0.17.0
<small>2026-07-04</small>

**New features**

- `msgvault backup` adds incremental, verifiable archive snapshots with
  `init`, `create`, `list`, `verify`, and `restore`. Snapshots capture the
  SQLite database, attachments, deletion audit files, and optional config/token
  extras into an append-only repository with byte-level verification.
- Google Calendar archive support via `msgvault add-calendar` and
  `msgvault sync-calendar`, including read-only event sync, recurring series,
  cancellations, scheduled `[[gcal]]` sync, and search with
  `--message-type calendar_event`.
- Microsoft Teams archive support via delegated Microsoft Graph sync.
  `msgvault add-teams` authorizes Graph access, `msgvault sync-teams` imports
  chats and channels, Teams messages are stored with `message_type = teams`,
  and `backfill-teams-media` can re-fetch hosted inline media for already
  imported messages.
- Search and query paths now understand message-type scoping. Local search
  accepts `message_type:` / `message_type=` query operators and the
  `--message-type` flag; HTTP, MCP, aggregate, and SQL-backed query surfaces
  expose the stored `message_type` so email, calendar events, text messages,
  Teams messages, and other imported records can be separated cleanly.
- Scoped embedding builds can restrict a vector generation to selected message
  types through `[vector.embed.scope].message_types`, with vector/hybrid search
  rejecting incompatible unscoped queries instead of treating a partial index as
  complete.
- The HTTP API is now generated through Huma with a checked-in OpenAPI contract
  (`msgvault openapi`, `/openapi.json`) and a generated Go client under
  `pkg/client`.
- Archive-access CLI commands now route through a msgvault daemon (the
  configured remote server, or a local background daemon that starts on
  demand and idles out after `[server].daemon_idle_timeout`). The daemon is
  the single archive writer: concurrent operations queue with a visible
  `Waiting:` message, read-only commands run immediately, and scheduled
  syncs yield to interactive commands. See the
  [Daemon Migration Guide](/guides/daemon-migration/).
- Daemon lifecycle management via `msgvault serve start|status|stop|restart`,
  with automatic restart of older local daemons on binary upgrade
  (`[server].daemon_auto_restart`).

**Improvements**

- IMAP resyncs skip unchanged folders using the mailbox `UIDVALIDITY` and
  `UIDNEXT` values captured after the previous completed sync.
- `msgvault serve stop` now explains long shutdown waits by reporting the
  daemon operation it is waiting for and periodically printing elapsed wait
  updates.
- MCP `get_message` returns large message bodies in windows instead of
  returning the whole body in one response.
- Vector embedding maintenance no longer uses a separate pending queue.
  Coverage is tracked per message with `embed_gen`, so rebuilds, repairs, and
  daemon top-ups all share the same scan-and-fill path.
- Full-sync batch errors are counted and persisted on the sync run, making
  source status and diagnostics more accurate after partial failures.
- The documentation site now lives in the repository, including CLI, API,
  setup, backup, calendar, daemon, PostgreSQL, and vector-search docs plus the
  docs build/check scripts.
- macOS users can install through Homebrew with `brew install msgvault`.
- The TUI migration to Bubble Tea v2 is complete.

**Deprecations**

- `tui --force-sql`, `tui --no-cache-build`, `tui --no-sqlite-scanner`,
  `mcp --force-sql`, and `mcp --no-sqlite-scanner` are deprecated (removal
  planned for a later release); engine and cache selection moved to the
  `[analytics]` config section.

**Bug fixes**

- MCP list/search requests now reject Gmail-only `list:` / `List-ID` search
  operators instead of treating them as local full-text terms.
- DuckDB query engines re-probe Parquet schema columns when the cache is
  rebuilt or replaced underneath a running process.
- Empty `subject:` and empty text search terms no longer match every message.
- Facebook Messenger imports preserve multiple attachments on one message
  instead of collapsing them into a single row.
- Imported message and reaction timestamps are normalized to UTC.
- TUI startup avoids mixed SQLite access while the daemon owns archive writes.
- API server documentation no longer overflows its sidebar on narrow layouts.
- Release publishing and the Nix update flow were corrected for the new module
  and release packaging.

## 0.15.0
<small>2026-05-28</small>

**New features**

- Microsoft Outlook PST archive import via `msgvault import-pst`, including folder labels, attachments, resumable checkpoints, and automatic skipping of non-email PST items.
- Facebook Messenger Download Your Information import via `msgvault import-messenger`, with JSON and HTML export support.
- SyncTech SMS Backup & Restore import via `msgvault import-synctech-sms`, plus Google Drive source configuration and one-shot sync commands for scheduled Android backups.
- Per-account identities, named collections, scoped search/stats, and reversible deduplication workflows across accounts and collections.
- Google service account support for Workspace domain-wide delegation, including per-app service account keys.
- Message detail API responses now expose `body_html`, and inline image MIME parts can be fetched through a dedicated inline endpoint.
- MCP StreamableHTTP transport with `msgvault mcp --http`.
- MCP `search_by_domains` tool for finding messages where any participant belongs to one of several domains.

**Improvements**

- Vector embedding management is consolidated under a single `msgvault embeddings` command, with `build`, `resume`, `list`, `activate`, and `retire` subcommands covering the full index-generation lifecycle. `msgvault build-embeddings` still works as a deprecated alias for `msgvault embeddings build`.
- Long messages are split into embedding chunks instead of being truncated to a single input.
- Embedding preprocessing now handles HTML bodies, base64/data blobs, URL tracking parameters, and whitespace cleanup more aggressively.
- Embedding progress reporting has steadier ETA handling, per-character timing, and better behavior when failed batches are downshifted.
- SQLite full-text search ranking better matches the weighting used by PostgreSQL-backed paths.
- iMessage imports can backfill participant display names from vCard contacts.
- Scheduled sync dispatch now resolves source type and supports IMAP sources as well as Gmail. `msgvault serve` can also schedule SyncTech SMS Backup & Restore Drive sources.
- SQLite sync paths are more durable and treat transient network failures as retryable scheduled-sync skips.
- Routine CLI command errors no longer print the full help output.
- Update checks avoid unnecessary GitHub API rate-limit pressure.
- Switch the Go module path to `go.kenn.io/msgvault`.

**Bug fixes**

- Domain-based search results now hide locally deleted rows.
- SQL slow/error logging includes query arguments and reports accurate streaming query durations.
- Embedding skips rows that become empty after preprocessing and surfaces API 4xx response bodies for easier troubleshooting.
- PST imports namespace source message IDs per archive so messages from different PST files no longer collide.

## 0.14
<small>2026-04-21</small>

**New features**

- **Vector search (semantic and hybrid).** msgvault can now embed your archive using a configured OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp `server`, LM Studio, etc.) and search it by meaning, not just keywords. `msgvault search --mode vector` runs pure semantic search; `--mode hybrid` fuses BM25 and vector similarity via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Exposed through local CLI search (`msgvault search`), the HTTP API (`GET /api/v1/search?mode=vector|hybrid`), and the MCP server (`search_messages` mode argument plus a new `find_similar_messages` tool). See [Vector Search](/usage/vector-search/).
- `msgvault build-embeddings` command to generate and maintain the local vector index. Incremental by default; `--full-rebuild` creates a new generation and atomically activates it once coverage reaches zero. Same-model rebuilds keep answering against the previous active generation while the new one is built, with active-generation top-ups frozen until activation; model or dimension changes return `index_stale` until activation.
- Background embedding via the daemon scheduler. A new `[vector.embed.schedule]` config block drives the embed worker on cron and/or after every successful scheduled sync, so `msgvault serve` can keep the vector index current without manual intervention.
- `/api/v1/stats` gains a `vector_search` sub-object reporting the active generation, any in-flight rebuild, and the actionable missing embedding count for the generation the worker will target next.
- `msgvault rebuild-fts` command to rebuild the SQLite FTS5 shadow table after corruption.

**Improvements**

- `search` command gains `--mode fts|vector|hybrid` and `--explain` flags. `--explain` includes per-signal scores (RRF, BM25, vector) in table and JSON output for ranking inspection.
- Configuration gains a full `[vector]` block with sub-tables for the embedding endpoint, message preprocessing, hybrid ranking, and the embed scheduler. See [Configuration: vector](/configuration/#vector).
- `remove-account` deletes attachment files from disk when they were unique to the removed account. Files shared across multiple accounts are preserved automatically, and an in-progress sync on any account skips file deletion to avoid racing new attachment writes.

**Bug fixes**

- `remove-account` no longer leaves orphaned attachment files on disk after an account's database rows are removed.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Yuriy Grinberg](https://github.com/webgress) for the first PostgreSQL dialect refactor, which laid groundwork for alternative storage backends.
- Thanks to [Matthew C Roberts](https://github.com/YourEconProf) for making `remove-account` clean up unshared attachment files safely.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for semantic and hybrid vector search, the embedding-generation workflow, background embedding scheduler, and the FTS5 rebuild recovery command.

## 0.13.1
<small>2026-04-15</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Fix importing older WhatsApp `msgstore.db` backups.

---

## 0.13
<small>2026-04-14</small>

**New features**

- Structured file logging with per-run correlation IDs. Every CLI invocation gets a unique `run_id` on every log line, making it easy to trace a single run across shared log files. New `msgvault logs` command for viewing and tailing logs. File logging is opt-in; see [Configuration: Log](/configuration/#log) for setup.

**Improvements**

- The terminal UI inherits your terminal background colors instead of forcing its own, so custom terminal themes (Dracula, Solarized, Nord, etc.) work naturally.

**Bug fixes**

- Improve full-text search performance across local archives.
- Improve terminal UI stability during rapid interactions (fix race condition where switching views could briefly show stale data).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Jesse Robbins](https://github.com/jesserobbins) for structured file logging with per-run correlation IDs, plus the full-text search performance fix and TUI race-condition fix.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for making the TUI inherit terminal background colors.

---

## 0.12.1
<small>2026-04-10</small>

**New features**

- Shell completion via `msgvault completion` for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.
- `MSGVAULT_IMAP_PASSWORD` environment variable and stdin piping for non-interactive `add-imap` (Docker, CI).
- Advanced search: word-boundary regex matching replaces ILIKE substring matching across all search paths, and FTS5 prefix search for the SQLite full-text index.
- Expanded store API with structured query parsing for search (`SearchMessagesQuery`).

**Improvements**

- Search result quality: text matching switched from ILIKE to word-boundary regex, reducing false positives from substring matches. SQLite aggregate sort ties are broken deterministically by key.
- Nix flake packaging metadata updated for 0.12.1.
- Docker image switched to `wolfi-base` with `libstdc++` for CGO/DuckDB compatibility, non-root user, and health check.

**Bug fixes**

- IMAP label handling: standard folders (Sent, Drafts, Trash, Junk, etc.) are now classified as system labels via RFC 6154 attributes and fallback name matching.
- `import-mbox` accepts plain mbox files with any extension (ZIP entries still require `.mbox`/`.mbx`), `--label` is repeatable/comma-separated, and re-imports update labels on existing messages instead of silently skipping.
- API search now uses the full structured query parser (operators like `from:`, `subject:`, date/size filters) instead of plain-text matching.
- `completion` command registered correctly in the CLI command tree.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Jesse Robbins](https://github.com/jesserobbins) for the advanced search work across regex matching, FTS5 prefix search, snippets, deterministic sorting, and related search-quality improvements.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for the completion-command registration fix, IMAP label handling fixes, MBOX import fixes, API structured-query search fix, and Docker image update.

## 0.12
<small>2026-04-09</small>

**New features**

- SQL query interface via `msgvault query`. Run arbitrary SQL against DuckDB over Parquet with `--format json|csv|table`. See [SQL Queries](/usage/querying/).
- Microsoft 365 OAuth2 support via `msgvault add-o365` for Outlook.com and organizational accounts. Auto-detects personal vs. org IMAP hosts.
- Text message import: `import-whatsapp`, `import-imessage`, and `import-gvoice` for WhatsApp, iMessage, and Google Voice. See [Text Messages](/usage/text-messages/).
- TUI text mode: press `m` to toggle between Email and Texts for browsing imported text conversations.
- `--after` and `--before` date filters for `sync-full` with IMAP accounts.
- CC and BCC recipients exposed in the message API responses.
- Claude Code skill for querying the archive via SQL views.

**Improvements**

- `delete-staged` now supports IMAP accounts (uses `UID STORE \Deleted` + `UID EXPUNGE`).
- Analytics cache is automatically rebuilt after write operations (sync, import, delete-staged) so stats stay current.
- `msgvault query` auto-rebuilds a stale cache before executing SQL.
- Improved archive query views and text-message search support.

**Bug fixes**

- `from:domain.com` search now matches domain patterns automatically for common TLDs. Uncommon TLDs still require the explicit `@` prefix (`from:@brand.pizza`).
- Wait for the IMAP server greeting before authenticating, fixing `unexpected EOF` errors with OAuth proxies.
- Fix label name conflict handling when ensuring Gmail labels (use `ON CONFLICT` upsert).
- Open the MCP database in read-only mode to prevent concurrent session hangs when multiple AI sessions query the archive.
