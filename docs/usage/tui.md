## Launch

```bash
msgvault tui
```

The TUI always talks to a msgvault HTTP server. Without `[remote].url`, it starts or reuses the local background daemon. The daemon owns database access, analytics engine selection, and cache rebuilds.

The daemon picks its analytics engine once at startup: DuckDB over the Parquet cache when a fresh, complete cache exists, live SQL otherwise. Opening aggregate views does not trigger a cache build — the daemon refreshes a stale cache after its scheduled syncs, and `msgvault build-cache` builds one on demand. When the daemon reports it fell back to live SQL (a freshly restored archive with no cache, for example), `msgvault tui` prints a notice and repeats it on the TUI's info line while views load; after `msgvault build-cache`, restart the daemon to switch it onto the cache. Configure engine selection in `config.toml`:

```toml
[analytics]
engine = "auto"          # auto, sql, or duckdb
auto_build_cache = true  # startup build under engine = "duckdb" only; scheduled-sync refreshes ignore it
```

Deprecated in 0.17.0: the old `msgvault tui --force-sql`, `--no-cache-build`, and `--no-sqlite-scanner` flags are hidden because these choices are now daemon configuration. Use `engine = "sql"` for live SQL, `auto_build_cache = false` to skip the automatic startup cache build, or `msgvault build-cache` to prebuild cache files on the daemon host. See [Configuration: analytics](/configuration/#analytics).

### Local And Remote

When your `config.toml` has a `[remote]` section configured, the TUI connects to the remote server automatically. All views, drill-downs, search, and filtering work the same as local-daemon mode. Use `--local` only when you want to force this machine's local daemon instead of the configured remote server.

```bash
# Connects to remote server if [remote] is configured
msgvault tui

# Force this machine's local daemon
msgvault tui --local
```

Deletion staging and attachment export use the selected daemon. When connected to a configured remote server, staged deletion manifests are saved on that remote host; attachment export streams bytes from the daemon and writes the zip file on the CLI machine.

Press `a` from any aggregate view to show all individual messages in that view. Press `Enter` on a message to view its full detail, including headers and body.

## View Modes

The TUI provides seven aggregate view modes. Press `g` to cycle through them:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| Senders | Aggregate by sender email address |
| Sender Names | Aggregate by sender display name (falls back to email when no name is set) |
| Recipients | Aggregate by recipient email address |
| Recipient Names | Aggregate by recipient display name (falls back to email when no name is set) |
| Domains | Aggregate by sender domain |
| Labels | Aggregate by Gmail label |
| Time | Aggregate by time period (year/month/day) |

### Time View

Press `t` from any view to jump directly to the Time view. The Time view aggregates messages by time period. When already in Time view, pressing `t` cycles between monthly, daily, and yearly granularity:

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Monthly</figcaption>

    <img src="/assets/generated/tui-time-daily.svg" alt="Time view: daily granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Daily</figcaption>
  </figure>

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Yearly</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Text Messages

Press `m` to toggle between Email and Texts mode. This mode is only available when text/chat data has been imported or synced. See [Text Messages](/usage/text-messages/) for details on importing WhatsApp, iMessage, Google Voice, Facebook Messenger, and SMS Backup & Restore conversations, and [Microsoft Teams](/usage/teams/) for Teams sync.

Text mode provides the following view types. Press `g` to cycle through them:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| Conversations | Aggregate by individual conversation |
| Contacts | Aggregate by contact phone number or identifier |
| Contact Names | Aggregate by contact display name (falls back to phone/ID when unavailable) |
| Sources | Aggregate by text service provider |
| Labels | Aggregate by custom labels or categories |
| Time | Aggregate by time period (year/month/day) |

Navigation and interaction in Text mode work the same as Email mode. Press `Enter` to drill into a conversation and view individual messages. Press `Esc` or `Backspace` to go back. Use `g` to re-aggregate from a drill-down view, `/` to search, and `f` to filter. The stats display shows message count and total size for text conversations.

## Drill-down and Sub-grouping

Press `Enter` to drill into any row. For example, selecting a sender shows their individual messages. Press `Esc` or `Backspace` to go back.
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/assets/generated/tui-drilldown.svg" alt="msgvault TUI drill-down showing messages from a specific sender" loading="lazy">
</figure>
From a drill-down view, press `g` to re-aggregate the filtered messages by a different dimension. You can think of this like an interactive pivot table. The cycle skips the dimension you drilled into — and when drilling from an email address view (Senders or Recipients), it also skips the corresponding name view since it would be redundant. For example, drilling into a sender and pressing `g` cycles through Recipients, Recipient Names, Domains, Labels, and Time.

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">A sender's mail grouped by month</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Searching

Press `/` to open a search bar that filters the current view in real time. Matching text is highlighted in the results. At the aggregate level (Senders, Domains, etc.), search uses the daemon's configured analytics engine, so the default local-daemon setup uses DuckDB over Parquet when the cache is usable.
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/assets/generated/tui-search-sender.svg" alt="msgvault TUI search filtering senders by name with highlighted matches" loading="lazy">
</figure>
Search also works after drill-down. Drill into a result, then press `/` again to search within that context. This second-level search uses deep FTS5 full-text search over message subjects and bodies. You can progressively narrow results: find a sender, drill in, then search for a specific subject or keyword.

</figure>
</div>

## Filtering

Press `f` to open the filter modal. The modal presents two independent toggles that you can combine:

| Filter | Effect |
|---|---|
| Only with attachments | Show only messages that have attachments |
| Hide deleted from source | Exclude messages that have been deleted from Gmail |
<figure class="screenshot" data-lightbox>
  <img src="/assets/generated/tui-filter-modal.svg" alt="msgvault TUI filter modal with checkbox toggles for attachments and hide deleted" loading="lazy">
</figure>
Use `↑`/`↓` to navigate, `Space` or `x` to toggle a filter, and `Enter` or `Esc` to apply and close. Active filters are shown in the title bar (e.g. `[Attachments]`, `[Hide Deleted]`). Filters apply to all views: aggregates, drill-downs, sub-aggregates, search results, and stats.

## Viewing Email Threads

From any message list (after drilling into a sender, label, domain, etc.), press `T` to open the full email thread for the highlighted message. This renders the complete conversation inline in the terminal, including sender, date, and body text for each message in the thread.

Press `Esc` to return to the message list.

## Marking Emails for Deletion

You can stage individual messages or bulk-delete entire aggregate groups (e.g. all emails from a sender, all messages with a given label) at once. Use `Space` to select one or more rows, then press `d` to stage them. From any aggregate view, press `D` to stage every message in the current group without selecting individual rows.

A confirmation dialog shows exactly how many messages will be staged before anything happens. Messages are not deleted immediately; they are placed in a deletion batch that you review and execute separately with `msgvault delete-staged`.

See [Deleting Email](/usage/deletion/) for the full deletion workflow.

## Performance

The default SQLite archive path uses DuckDB querying Parquet metadata exports for aggregate views. This architecture delivers aggregate queries (top senders, domains, labels, time series) **hundreds of times faster** than equivalent SQLite JOINs. The Parquet analytics layer has a small footprint, so drill-down and re-aggregation feel instant even on very large archives. Configure `[analytics].engine` if you need to force live SQL or require DuckDB.

See [Data Storage](/architecture/storage/) for details on how this works.
