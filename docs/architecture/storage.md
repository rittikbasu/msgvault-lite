## Storage Layers

| Layer | Role | Location |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | Default system of record | `~/.msgvault/msgvault.db` |
| PostgreSQL | Optional system of record | `[data].database_url` |
| Parquet | Analytics cache | `~/.msgvault/analytics/` |
| Attachments | Content-addressed files | `~/.msgvault/attachments/` |
| Tokens | OAuth credentials | `~/.msgvault/tokens/` |

## Archive Database

All message data (metadata, labels, participants, and raw MIME) lives in the configured archive database. SQLite is the default and stores the archive at `~/.msgvault/msgvault.db`. PostgreSQL is opt-in through `[data].database_url` and is intended for new archives or fresh re-syncs.

### Core Tables

| `recipient_type` | TEXT | `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc` |

**labels / message_labels** -- Gmail labels (many-to-many).

| Table | Key Columns |
|---|---|
| `labels` | `id`, `source_id`, `source_label_id`, `name`, `label_type` |
| `message_labels` | `message_id`, `label_id` |

**sync_runs / sync_run_items / sync_checkpoints / source_import_items** -- Sync and import state for resumability and diagnostics.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sync_runs` | Track each sync operation (start, end, counts, errors) |
| `sync_run_items` | Track per-message fetch, ingest, delete, skip, and error outcomes inside a sync run |
| `sync_checkpoints` | Resume point per source (message ID, page token) |
| `source_import_items` | Track file/object-level imports from resumable adapters, including provider ID, checksum, status, and import errors |

Per-item sync diagnostics keep a failed message visible without hiding
successful work from the same run. Actionable item failures are recorded with
`status = 'error'`, `phase` values such as `fetch`, `ingest`, or `delete`, and
an `error_kind`/`error_message`. Expected churn, such as a Gmail message that
disappears before raw fetch, is recorded as `status = 'skipped'`.

`source_import_items.checksum` is nullable because some providers or legacy rows
may not have a stable checksum. msgvault treats a null checksum as an empty
string when checking already-imported source items.

### Full-Text Index

SQLite uses an FTS5 virtual table named `messages_fts`. PostgreSQL uses a `search_fts` `tsvector` column on `messages` with a GIN index.

Both power `msgvault search`, but the rankers differ. See [Search Ranking Across Backends](/architecture/search-ranking/).

### Relationships

```
sources ─┬─< conversations ─< messages ─┬─< message_recipients ─> participants
         │                               ├─< message_labels ─> labels
         │                               ├── message_raw
         │                               └─< attachments
         └─< labels
```

## PostgreSQL Backend

PostgreSQL uses native types such as `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `BYTEA`, and `JSONB`. Message, source, participant, label, attachment, and sync tables map to the same logical model as SQLite.

For semantic search, pgvector stores index generations, pending embedding work, and embedding vectors in the same PostgreSQL database. There is no separate `vectors.db` on PostgreSQL.

There is currently no SQLite to PostgreSQL migration command. Use PostgreSQL for a new archive or re-sync/import into an empty PostgreSQL database. See [PostgreSQL Backend](/architecture/postgresql/) for setup and operational notes.

## Parquet (Analytics Cache)

The TUI needs to aggregate across your entire archive (top senders, domains, labels, time series) and return results instantly as you drill down. SQLite JOINs across normalized tables cannot do this at interactive speeds on large archives. msgvault solves this on the default SQLite backend with denormalized Parquet files queried by an embedded DuckDB engine, delivering aggregate queries hundreds of times faster than SQLite.

The Parquet cache is disposable and can be rebuilt at any time. Aggregate views never trigger a build: the daemon picks its engine once at startup (DuckDB when a fresh, complete cache exists, live SQL otherwise), refreshes a stale cache after its scheduled syncs, and builds one at startup only under `engine = "duckdb"` with `auto_build_cache = true`. `msgvault build-cache` builds the cache on demand; the daemon switches onto it at its next restart. PostgreSQL archives currently use live SQL for aggregate views rather than this Parquet acceleration layer.

```bash
# Manual build
msgvault build-cache

# Full rebuild (discard existing)
msgvault build-cache --full-rebuild
```

Directory structure:

```
analytics/
├── messages/
│   ├── year=2020/
│   ├── year=2021/
│   └── ...
├── participants/
├── message_recipients/
├── labels/
├── attachments/
├── sources/
├── conversations/
├── message_labels/
└── _last_sync.json
```

Messages are partitioned by year for efficient time-range queries. The entire analytics cache is typically a few MB even for hundreds of thousands of messages, compared to the much larger SQLite database with full message bodies.

## Content-Addressed Attachments

Every attachment from every message (PDFs, photos, documents, spreadsheets, archives) is extracted and stored as a plain file on your local filesystem. No more digging through Gmail's web UI or hitting API rate limits to retrieve your own files. Once synced, they are yours to browse, back up, or process however you like.

Attachments are deduplicated by SHA-256 hash:

```
attachments/
├── ab/
│   └── abcd1234567890...   # full SHA-256 hash as filename
├── cd/
│   └── cdef9876543210...
└── ...
```

The first two characters of the hash form the subdirectory (sharding). Multiple messages referencing the same attachment share one file.

## Token Storage

OAuth tokens are stored as JSON files per account:

```
tokens/
├── personal@gmail.com.json
└── work@company.com.json
```

Tokens refresh automatically. Protect this directory; tokens grant read/write access to Gmail.

## Compression

| Data | Format | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Raw MIME | zlib in database BLOB/BYTEA | ~3-5x compression |
| Parquet | Snappy (DuckDB default) | ~10x vs raw SQLite |
| Attachments | Stored as-is (already compressed formats) | — |
