description: Archive Microsoft Teams chats and channels through delegated Microsoft Graph sync.
---

msgvault can archive Microsoft Teams chats and channel messages into the same
local archive as email, calendar events, and text-message imports. Teams
messages are stored with `message_type = teams`, so they can be searched,
queried, and embedded without mixing them into ordinary email-only workflows.

Teams sync is read-only: msgvault reads messages through Microsoft Graph and
does not send messages, edit Teams content, or modify channel membership.

## Prerequisites

Teams ingestion uses Microsoft Graph delegated OAuth, not IMAP. It requires the
same `[microsoft]` `client_id` config block used by `add-o365`, but it stores a
separate Graph token under `tokens/teams_<email>.json`. An Outlook IMAP token
created by `add-o365` does not authorize Teams sync.

Register a Microsoft Entra app as described in
[OAuth Setup](/guides/oauth-setup/#microsoft-365-outlook-hotmail), with:

- Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8089/callback/microsoft`
- Public client flows enabled
- Delegated Microsoft Graph permissions:
  `Chat.Read`, `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, `Team.ReadBasic.All`,
  `Channel.ReadBasic.All`, `User.Read`, and `User.ReadBasic.All`

Some tenants require an administrator to grant consent for channel-message
permissions before users can authorize the app.

Configure msgvault:

```toml
[microsoft]
client_id = "your-azure-app-client-id"
# tenant_id = "your-org-tenant-id"  # optional; default is "common"
```

## Authorize Teams

```bash
msgvault add-teams user@example.com
```

The command opens a browser, requests the Graph scopes above, verifies the
returned identity, stores the token as `teams_user@example.com.json`, creates a
`teams` source, and confirms the account email as the default "me" identity.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--tenant` | Azure AD tenant ID for this authorization; defaults to `common` |
| `--no-default-identity` | Do not auto-confirm the email address as this source's "me" identity |

## Sync Teams

```bash
# Full first run or incremental later runs are auto-detected.
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com

# Chats only
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com --no-channels

# Test with a per-conversation limit
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com --limit 100

# Re-fetch all messages and upsert them in place
msgvault sync-teams user@example.com --full
```

The first run walks chats, joined teams, channels, root channel messages, and
replies. Later runs resume from stored cursors and checkpoints. If a run is
interrupted, re-run `sync-teams`; completed conversations are skipped and
incomplete ones continue.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--no-channels` | Sync chats only and skip team channels |
| `--limit` | Maximum messages per conversation (`0` means no limit) |
| `--full` | Ignore stored cursors and re-fetch every message, repairing/backfilling rows in place |

## What Gets Archived

- One-on-one chats, group chats, meeting chats, team channels, and channel
  replies.
- Plain-text body text derived from Graph HTML bodies, plus the original HTML
  body when present.
- Sender and conversation members as participants, so Teams contacts can appear
  in the same contact graph as email and text-message contacts.
- The original Graph message JSON in raw-message storage with format
  `teams_json`.
- Link attachments as attachment references.
- Inline hosted-content images downloaded into msgvault's attachment store.
- Call-recording event links in the searchable body text.

Deleted Teams messages are marked deleted in the archive when Graph reports a
`deletedDateTime`; existing rows are not silently left active.

## Inline Media Backfill

If you imported Teams messages before inline hosted-content downloads were
available, or a transient Graph error left some inline images missing, run:

```bash
msgvault backfill-teams-media user@example.com
msgvault backfill-teams-media user@example.com --only-incomplete
```

The backfill scans stored Teams HTML bodies for `hostedContents` URLs and
downloads those images into the attachment store. It is idempotent because
attachment storage is content-addressed.

## Scheduled Sync

`msgvault serve` can schedule Teams syncs through the normal `[[accounts]]`
block after `add-teams` creates the source and token:

```toml
[[accounts]]
email = "user@example.com"
schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
enabled = true
```

The scheduler resolves the entry to the `teams` source when that account has a
Teams source. Scheduled Teams syncs include channels.

## Search and Query

Teams messages use `message_type = teams`:

```bash
msgvault search "incident review" --message-type teams
msgvault search "message_type:teams incident review"
msgvault query --format table "
  SELECT sent_at, from_email, subject, snippet
  FROM v_messages
  WHERE message_type = 'teams'
  ORDER BY sent_at DESC
  LIMIT 20
"
```

Manual `sync-teams` does not run the embedding worker immediately. If vector
search is enabled and you want newly synced Teams messages in semantic/hybrid
results, run `msgvault embeddings build` after the sync, or configure
`[vector.embed.schedule].run_after_sync = true` for scheduled daemon syncs.

In the [TUI](/usage/tui/), press `m` to switch from Email mode to Texts mode.
Teams direct chats, group chats, and channel conversations appear alongside
other text/chat sources in that view.
