title: Backup Repository Format
description: On-disk format reference for msgvault backup repositories - layout, object encodings, versioning, crash-consistency, and the freeze protocol.
---

This page is the format reference for the backup repository created by [`msgvault backup`](/usage/backup/). It documents the invariants an implementation must preserve, in enough detail to audit a repository by hand or reimplement a reader.

## Design Goals

- **Local-first, tool-agnostic.** A repository is a plain directory of write-once files. Any file-sync tool can replicate it; no server or database is required to read it.
- **Content-addressed and deduplicated.** Every stored object is a blob named by the SHA-256 of its (uncompressed, unencrypted) content. Identical content is stored once, across snapshots and across data types.
- **Crash-safe by construction.** A snapshot exists if and only if its manifest file exists, and the manifest is written last. There is no repair step and no journal.
- **Verifiable.** Every container and metadata object carries integrity checksums; full verification re-derives every referenced blob's identity from its bytes.
- **Versioned at every level.** Readers refuse what they cannot safely interpret rather than guessing.

## Repository Layout

```
<repo>/
  config.toml              # repo identity + format versions (plain TOML)
  snapshots/
    <snapshot-id>.mvmanifest   # JSON manifest, written LAST
  packs/
    <aa>/<ulid>.mvpack     # sealed blob containers (~32 MB target), aa = first ID byte
  indexes/
    <ulid>.mvidx           # immutable blob -> (pack, offset) indexes
  locks/                   # exclusive.json / shared-<ulid>.json
  staging/                 # temp files; atomically renamed into place
```

All multi-byte integers in every binary object are **little-endian**. All timestamps are UTC.

## Versioning Model

Compatibility is enforced at three levels, all of which must pass:

1. **Repository level.** `config.toml` records `format_version` (what wrote it) and `min_reader_version` (the oldest format a reader must understand). `Open` refuses a repository whose `min_reader_version` exceeds the reader's supported version, with an explicit "upgrade msgvault" error. A future format change that old readers can safely ignore bumps only `format_version`; a change they cannot safely ignore also bumps `min_reader_version`.
2. **Object level.** Every binary object begins with a 4-byte magic and a version field, and every decoder rejects an unknown magic or version. A reader can therefore never misparse an object from a future format as if it were current.
3. **Snapshot level.** Each manifest records its own `format_version`, `min_reader_version`, and the `msgvault_version` string that wrote it, so compatibility can evolve per-snapshot within one repository (for example, when a future version introduces encrypted snapshots alongside existing plaintext ones). Version 2 marks snapshots whose attachment population records storage paths beyond the canonical `<aa>/<hash>` derivation: version-1 readers placed every restored attachment at the canonical path and would materialize a database pointing at files that do not exist, so they must refuse these snapshots. Snapshots whose recorded paths are all canonical keep version 1.

Integrity is separate from versioning: every metadata object ends with a SHA-256 trailer over everything before it, checked before any field is interpreted, and pack entries carry CRC32-C over the stored bytes.

## Blob Identity

```
BlobID = SHA-256(plaintext content)
```

The ID is always computed over the raw content — before compression, before any future encryption. Compression and encryption are storage transforms recorded per-entry in the pack; they never change identity. This is what makes deduplication stable across compression-level changes and future format evolution.

## Pack Files (`.mvpack`)

Blobs are appended into pack files sealed at a ~32 MB target. A sealed pack is never modified.

```
header:   "MVPK" | version u8 (=1) | flags u8
frames:   one frame per blob, concatenated
footer:   entry table | footer trailer ("KPVM" magic, SHA-256 over footer region)
```

Each footer entry records the blob ID, offset, stored length, raw length, CRC32-C of the stored bytes, and per-blob flags (`compressed`, `encrypted`). Each frame is either the raw content or a zstd frame: compression (level 3 by default, `zstd_level` configurable 1–19) is kept only if it saves at least 3%, so already-compressed content (most media attachments) is stored raw rather than burning CPU for nothing. Raw blob size is capped at 4 GiB (`maxRawLen`), and readers reject stored lengths beyond that bound plus a small overhead allowance before allocating.

Reading a blob verifies, in order: the footer trailer hash (at open), the entry CRC over stored bytes, then — after decompression — that SHA-256 of the result equals the blob ID.

## Index Objects (`.mvidx`, magic `MVIX`)

Immutable mappings from blob ID to pack location, written once per `create` after its packs are sealed:

```
"MVIX" | version u16 (=1) | entry_count u32 |
entries: blob_id [32] | pack_ulid [16] | offset u64 | stored_len u64 | flags u8   (65 bytes each)
SHA-256 trailer
```

Entries are strictly sorted by blob ID; decoders reject unsorted or duplicate entries. Readers load the union of all index files. An index file orphaned by an interrupted backup (index written, manifest never written) is safe by construction: indexes are only ever written after their packs are durably sealed, so an orphan references real, valid blobs and deduplicating against it is correct.

## Page-Hash Objects (magic `MVHK` keyframe / `MVHD` delta)

The incremental-capture state: the truncated SHA-256 (first 16 bytes) of every 4 KB database page.

```
keyframe: "MVHK" | version u16 | page_size u32 | page_count u64 | hashes (page_count x 16) | trailer
delta:    "MVHD" | version u16 | page_size u32 | new page_count u64 | entry_count u32 |
          pages (u64 each, strictly ascending) | hashes (entry_count x 16) | trailer
```

Applying a delta resizes to the new page count (growth zero-fills, shrinking truncates) and patches the listed pages. All count and size fields are validated overflow-safely against the actual body length before any allocation.

## Page-Map Objects (magic `MVMK` keyframe / `MVMD` delta)

Where each database page's content lives, as sorted, non-overlapping runs:

```
"MVMK"/"MVMD" | version u16 | page_size u32 | page_count u64 | blob_count u32 |
blob table (32-byte blob IDs) | run_count u32 |
runs: start_page u64 | page_count u32 | blob_index u32 | blob_offset u64   (24 bytes each)
SHA-256 trailer
```

A keyframe must cover `[0, page_count)` with no gaps; deltas are sparse. Delta application unions the blob tables, subtracts the delta's intervals from the base runs (splitting runs with byte-exact offset adjustment), and merges — a linear sweep over both sorted run lists. Materializing a snapshot's map and concatenating the referenced page ranges reproduces the database file byte-for-byte; the end-to-end test asserts exactly that.

**Capture grouping:** contiguous dirty ranges of ≥ 256 pages become dedicated blobs, split at 1024 pages (4 MiB); smaller scattered ranges are grouped into shared blobs of at most 1024 pages.

**Keyframe cadence:** a snapshot writes fresh keyframes (instead of deltas) when the chain would exceed 30 deltas or when the accumulated deltas' stored size exceeds the previous keyframe's, bounding both chain-walk depth and wasted space. Chain walks independently enforce cycle detection and the depth bound, so corrupted parent links fail deterministically.

## Attachment Lists (magic `MVAL`)

```
"MVAL" | version u16 (=1) | entry_count u32 |
entries: content SHA-256 [32] | size u64   (40 bytes, first-seen order)
SHA-256 trailer
```

A snapshot's manifest references one or more list blobs whose union is exactly the attachment population of that snapshot. In the common append-only case, a snapshot inherits its parent's list blobs and adds one new segment; when the live set has shrunk (attachments were deleted), the snapshot writes one fresh full list instead, so the union invariant holds in both directions. Attachment content is re-read and re-hashed from disk at every capture — a file whose bytes no longer match its recorded hash fails the backup rather than being stored wrong.

## Snapshot Manifests

A manifest is indented JSON with a fixed field set: format versions, `snapshot_id`, `parent_id`, `created_at` (RFC 3339 UTC), capture options, database geometry and page-map/hash-map chain heads, attachment lists and totals, extras tree, exclusions, stats, the packs and index added, duration, and bytes added.

**Snapshot ID derivation:**

```
snapshot_id = <UTC yyyymmddTHHMMSSZ> + "-" + first 32 hex chars (128 bits) of
              SHA-256(compact JSON of the manifest with snapshot_id = "")
```

The ID is content-derived: identical content at the same second produces the same ID, and any change to the manifest changes it. Readers recompute the ID from the manifest body on load and refuse a mismatch with the filename or embedded `snapshot_id`, so a renamed, corrupted, or forged manifest is rejected; the 128-bit digest keeps crafting a different manifest with the same ID computationally infeasible. `create` additionally enforces **strictly monotonic timestamps** per repository (bumping past the parent's second when two snapshots land within one second), so lexicographic ID order is chronological order and parent selection is deterministic.

Manifests hash Go's canonical struct-order JSON encoding, and the manifest contains no map-typed fields, so serialization is fully deterministic. This is a deliberate reason the format uses JSON rather than a schema-compiled encoding such as protobuf: protobuf serialization is not canonical across implementations or library versions, which would break content-derived IDs, and its silently-ignore-unknown-fields evolution model is the opposite of what a backup format wants — unknown data must be refused via explicit versioning, not skipped. JSON manifests are also inspectable with nothing but `cat` and `jq`, which matters when debugging a decade-old repository.

## Crash Consistency

Every repository file is published atomically: written to `staging/`, fsynced, renamed into place, parent directory synced. Within one `create`, the write order is:

1. Pack files sealed (durable),
2. Index object written,
3. Manifest written **last**.

A crash at any point leaves either a complete snapshot or no snapshot — never a manifest referencing missing data. Data orphaned before the manifest write (sealed packs, an index) is unreferenced garbage: harmless, deduplicated against by later runs, and reclaimable by a future prune command.

## Locking

`create` holds an exclusive lock; `verify` holds a shared lock (concurrent verifies allowed). Locks are JSON files under `locks/` recording hostname, PID, operation, and acquisition time; holders refresh the file mtime every 30 seconds after re-verifying they still own the file, and locks older than 30 minutes are reaped as stale. Acquisition uses a plant-then-recheck handshake on both sides to close the create/verify race window, and release re-reads the file and removes it only if every field still matches the holder's own record.

## Freeze Protocol

To capture a transactionally consistent database image while the daemon is running:

1. The backup subprocess calls the daemon's same-host-only (loopback, or the daemon's own bind address), authenticated `POST /api/v1/backup/freeze/begin`, which acquires the daemon's serial operation gate (pausing conflicting maintenance work) and returns a token. A 60-second watchdog on the daemon auto-releases the gate if the backup dies.
2. The subprocess opens its own SQLite connection, runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` (with bounded retries) until the WAL is empty, then pins a read transaction — from this point the main database file bytes cannot change under it.
3. It immediately calls `freeze/end` with the token. The gate is released and normal daemon writes resume; the pinned transaction alone keeps the file image stable for the page scan. Database geometry, statistics, and attachment locators are all read inside the pinned transaction.

The freeze window is therefore milliseconds-to-seconds regardless of archive size. `backup create` refuses to run unfrozen against a live daemon: if the daemon's runtime record cannot be resolved, the backup fails rather than risking a torn read.

## Restore

`backup restore` materializes one snapshot into a target directory as a usable archive home: the database written run-by-run at `page × page_size` from the materialized page map, attachments at the storage paths the restored database records for each hash (importers may namespace paths beyond the loose `<hash[:2]>/<hash>` layout; paths are re-validated as local before writing), and captured extras at their recorded relative paths and file modes (tree entry paths are re-validated as local and traversal-free before writing). It refuses a non-empty target without `--overwrite` and refuses the live archive home of a running daemon outright.

Restore is self-proving, in layers. During materialization every blob read re-derives its SHA-256 identity (the pack reader's normal contract) and every database page is additionally checked against the snapshot's page-hash map before it is written — so a page-map bug cannot silently place correct bytes at the wrong offset. After materialization the restored database must pass `PRAGMA integrity_check` and reproduce the manifest's recorded stats through exactly the queries capture ran inside the freeze window; the end-to-end test further proves the restored file is byte-identical to the live database as it existed at capture time, including for parent snapshots restored from an incremental chain. All files, and the directory entries naming them, are fsynced before restore reports success. Pack reads are grouped by pack with a `--jobs` worker bound (1 = strictly serial for spinning-disk repositories); serial and parallel restores produce byte-identical trees. Restoring an old backup onto a newer msgvault goes through normal schema migration at first open, the same path as any upgrade.

## Verification Model

`verify` enumerates every blob a manifest can reach — page-map chains and their blob tables, hash-map chains, attachment lists and every listed content hash, the extras tree and its entries — and checks each against the index and packs. Quick mode proves structure (references resolve, objects decode, packs exist); full mode additionally reads every referenced blob and re-derives its SHA-256 identity, and confirms materialized page/hash maps match the manifest's recorded geometry with full coverage. Problems are collected, not fail-fast, and each names the snapshot, blob, and pack involved.

## Current Limitations

- Repository encryption and retention (forget/prune) are not yet implemented; the format reserves flags and fields for them (`encryption` in the repo config, the `encrypted` blob flag, crypter parameters threaded through the code as nil).
- The archive database must be SQLite; PostgreSQL deployments are not supported.
- The daemon operation gate is held only through the freeze protocol (checkpoint plus read-transaction pin), not through attachment capture. A gated operation that deletes attachment files (such as `remove-account`) while a backup is still capturing can therefore delete a file the frozen database still references; the backup then fails loudly with a read or hash error and can be retried after the deletion completes. This is a deliberate trade: holding the gate — and with it every daemon write — for the full capture window would be far more disruptive than a rare retryable backup failure. A snapshot that completed is unaffected: it captured every file it references.

## Roadmap (settled design, not yet implemented)

The following behaviors were designed alongside the shipped format — the format hooks for them already exist — and are recorded here as the binding intent for the follow-up phases.

A `verify --restore-check` mode performing the full restore materialization proof against scratch space, without writing a target, remains planned.

**Encryption.** `backup init --encrypt` generates a random 256-bit repository key; every blob, footer, index, and manifest is encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305, with the AAD binding each ciphertext to its identity (blob ID, or object role plus ID). The repository key is wrapped with [age](https://age-encryption.org) to one or more recipients (scrypt passphrase and/or X25519 identities) in `keys/master.age`; adding, removing, or rotating recipients rewraps the key without rewriting objects. `config.toml` stays plaintext by necessity; tampering yields detectable failures, not silent corruption. Key loss is unrecoverable by design. Blob IDs remain plaintext-content hashes but appear only inside encrypted metadata.

**Retention.** `forget` deletes manifest files (refusing to drop the last snapshot without `--force`); `prune` takes the exclusive lock, walks the remaining manifests to collect the live blob set, deletes fully-dead packs, repacks packs below 50% live content, and writes merged indexes — with new packs and indexes durable before anything is deleted, so a crash mid-prune never breaks reference closure. Until these ship, purged archive content persists in historical snapshots (see [Deleted and Purged Messages](/usage/backup/#deleted-and-purged-messages)).

**Packed live attachment storage (opt-in).** A future `[storage] attachment_format = "packed"` mode stores live attachment content in the same pack container format, with the `attachments.storage_path` column carrying a `pack:<ulid>:<offset>:<stored_len>:<flags>` locator, plus `attachments migrate` (loose → packed, resumable, hash-verified) and `attachments compact` (rewrite packs past a dead-space threshold). Backups are layout-independent by design — they address attachment content by SHA-256 either way — so switching the live layout never invalidates or re-uploads existing backup content.

**Performance follow-ups.** Two accepted deferrals from review: detecting a same-page-size `VACUUM` by delta-ratio anomaly (warn that a keyframe would be cheaper), and a streaming page-map merge for memory-constrained hosts. Further out: `backup export` (one self-contained archive file), WAL shipping for point-in-time recovery, native remote backends, and daemon-scheduled backups.
